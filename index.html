            Hi, my name is Bishoy!

            This website is structered to be my own online portfolio. Here I
            list many of the coding projects I have done in the past and I hope
            to showcase many more projects. I might even start adding blogs and
            random commentary that I find interesting!
        </p>

            My hobbies include computers, video games, trading card games, 
            anime, and cooking. I also am trying to learn how to skateboard and
            astrophotography. A book I am curently reading right now is Dune.
